    description: |
      Navigate to the 'Bills' list.
      Count the visible items (or verify pagination count).
      Does List Count == Dashboard Count? (Rigor Check).
    glm_prompt: "Does the number of bills in the list match the dashboard total?"
    expected: "Counts match exactly"

    description: |
      Check the 'Activity Trend' chart (if available) or recent history.
      If a new bill was added today, the trend should show activity 'Today'.
    glm_prompt: "Does the activity log/chart show recent activity corresponding to today?"
    expected: "Trend reflects recent ingestion"

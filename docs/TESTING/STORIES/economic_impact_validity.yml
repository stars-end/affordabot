    description: |
      Open the 'Golden Data' test bill (BILL-TEST-101) which contains a known 
      $500/year property tax increase.
      Verify the Raw Data tab confirms this text is present.
    glm_prompt: "Does the Raw Data view show text mentioning '$500 property tax increase'?"
    expected: "Raw text confirms input data"

  - id: step-2-validate-impact-score
    description: |
      Check the 'Economic Analysis' tab. 
      The 'Direct Cost' score should be High (8-10).
      The 'Housing Affordability' dimension should be High Negative.
    glm_prompt: "What is the Direct Cost score? Is Housing Affordability marked as Negative Impact?"
    expected: "Score > 8 and Negative Housing Impact"

    description: |
      Read the 'Reasoning' section.
      It should cite 'Property Tax' as a direct supply-side cost driver.
      (Econ 101: Tax incidence logic).
    glm_prompt: "Does the reasoning explicitly link property tax to increased housing costs?"
    expected: "Reasoning cites tax incidence"

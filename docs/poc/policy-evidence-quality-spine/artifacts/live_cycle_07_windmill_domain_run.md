## Storage Evidence Gates
- postgres_rows_written: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)
- pgvector_index_probe: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)
- minio_object_refs: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)

- analysis_provenance_chain: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)
- quality_gate_blocked_before_index_analyze: `not_applicable` (current run completed past read_fetch; reader quality block was not expected in this success path)
- idempotent_rerun: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)

- stale_drill_stale_blocked: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)
- failure_handler_drill: `not_run` (failure injection is a separate pre-schedule gate; this San Jose product path run verified the native failure handler surface was configured)
- bridge_mode: `railway_runtime` ()

## Backend Endpoint Readiness
- status: `ready_for_opt_in`
- note: backend endpoint config is present and local mock probe passed
- missing_inputs: `[]`

## Manual Audit Notes
- reader_output_excerpt: -
- reader_quality_note: Reader output was persisted and provided to analysis.
- llm_analysis_excerpt: The evidence reviews theoretical and empirical studies on impact fee incidence. Ihlanfeldt and Shaughnessy (2004) provide qualitative estimates suggesting developers are fully compensated for fees through higher new home prices, and that new and existing home prices rise equally due to perceived property tax savings, a finding the text critiques as unrealistic. A separate study in Dunedin, Florida, provides quantitative data showing a $1,150 fee led to a $2,600 increase in new housing prices and a $1,643 increase in existing housing prices, though these effects were temporary, dissipating over six years.
- llm_quality_note: LLM analysis produced a substantive answer from persisted evidence.
- manual_verdict: PASS_MANUAL_AUDIT

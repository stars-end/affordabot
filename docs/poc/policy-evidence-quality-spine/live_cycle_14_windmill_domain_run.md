## Storage Evidence Gates
- postgres_rows_written: `passed` (Postgres product rows found)
- pgvector_index_probe: `passed` (document_chunks rows found with embeddings (9148))
- minio_object_refs: `passed` (storage_uri refs present in content_artifacts)
- reader_output_ref: `passed` (content_artifacts rows found)
- analysis_provenance_chain: `passed` (successful analyze command row found)
- quality_gate_blocked_before_index_analyze: `not_applicable` (current run completed past read_fetch; reader quality block was not expected in this success path)
- idempotent_rerun: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)
- stale_drill_stale_but_usable: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)
- stale_drill_stale_blocked: `pending` (not proven in Windmill stub run; requires Worker A product bridge + live storage adapters)
- failure_handler_drill: `not_run` (failure injection is a separate pre-schedule gate; this San Jose product path run verified the native failure handler surface was configured)
- bridge_mode: `railway_runtime` ()

## Backend Endpoint Readiness
- status: `ready_for_opt_in`
- note: backend endpoint config is present and local mock probe passed

# affordabot-uw1 — Implement jules-dispatch skill in agent-skills

## Goal
Provide a reliable “dispatch to Jules” workflow for self-contained tasks, including required context packets and verification expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Skill can generate a context-rich prompt from a Beads issue and spawn a Jules session.
- Output includes: repo/branch, files to touch, verification command(s).

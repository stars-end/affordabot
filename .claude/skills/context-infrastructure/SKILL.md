- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment workflow (if exists)
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Test workflow (if exists)

## Docker

- `Dockerfile` (root) - Docker configuration (if exists)
- `docker-compose*.yml` - Docker Compose (if exists)

## Smoke Tests

- `backend/smoke_endpoints.py` - Backend health checks
- `frontend/e2e-smoke/*.spec.ts` - Frontend smoke tests

## Scripts
